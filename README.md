# gravity

A micro codebase that plays around with some mathematically dubious riffs on Newton's law of universal gravitation,
in order to produce some pretty (though unrealistic) animations.

## Trying it Out
Clone the repo, then run:

```shell
$ clj -i test.clj -r
```

Look for the Java GUI window, bring it into focus, and after 5 seconds an initial random simulation will start.  Press
any key to close the window and be dropped into a REPL.

To run another random simulation, with between 3 and 25 randomly located objects:

```clojure
(gg/simulate width height (gen-random-objs 3 25))
```

You may redefine `width` and/or `height` (both integers) to obtain a larger window (the default is 800x600).
